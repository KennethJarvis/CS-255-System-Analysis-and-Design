# CS-255-System-Analysis-and-Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project involved developing a system that helped customers learn how to drive. There were courses, practice tests, appointment scheduling for driving lessons, 
and updates from the DMV when there were changes to the driving laws. The company DriverPass was the client looking to hire someone to develop software for them. The system they wanted was web-based, with the ability to access it from a web browser.

What did you do particularly well?

I found I did UML designs particularly well. I enjoyed developing intricate representations, and it helped me visualize the project.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could go back, I would choose to revisit the requirements stage and put more detail into the design. I found that I left a lot of interpretations that needed to be more defined. It would have allowed me to make better UML diagrams.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I had a log of the conversation detailing the desires of the client. With the details in hand, I carved out a diagram showing how the system would work. It is essential to consider the user's needs when designing to create an efficient and practical application. The user is on the website to solve a problem, the website needs to be catered to that.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I like to approach designing software one step at a time. I would follow the system from beginning to end to understand. Then I would create a diagram for my team to use and edit as we progress. The SDLC process helps clarify initial plans and is a powerful ally in development, which I will utilize.
